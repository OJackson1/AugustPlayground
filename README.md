# AugustPlayground

This is not a game for the August SDET intake to mess around in!

If you want to add stuff to this amazing repo, you need to make your own branch and start a Pull Request telling me why it's worth including your branch! I like trains.

Use the [Pull Requests module](https://portal.qa-community.co.uk/~/sdet/learning/git/git--pull-requests) for guidance. :)
